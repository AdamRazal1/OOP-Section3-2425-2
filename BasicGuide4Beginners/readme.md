git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

---

## ðŸ›  Step 7: Push Changes to GitHub

Push your changes to the **main** branch:

```

_For older repositories, you may need to push to `master`:_

```bash

3. Commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "your commit message"
   ```
4. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

## ðŸ›  Step 10: Pull Latest Changes (Collaboration)

If you are working with a team, always pull the latest changes before making new commits:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

---

## ðŸ›  Optional: Create and Use Branches

### Create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch
```

### Push the new branch to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin feature-branch
```

---
